# Steps up to now

## STEP 0-2
- Added a vite.config.js - we really don't need to add this, but it gives us some flexibility on how we want to make the builds later
- Added bootstrap with `npm i bootstrap@5.3.0-alpha1` We use this version because bootstrap says to use it as the newest version (there must be a problem with 5.2)

## STEP 0-1
- Removed all the unnecessary files
- Cleaned out the index.html
